# Shellpedia
Collection of Shells and Web Shells

Shellpedia is meant to be a repository/collection of Shells and Web Shells developed by me and/or authors in the Internet, and ways to use them. Here you will find Web Shells such as PHP, ASP, .NET, JavaScript, Java, JSP, etc. Also system shells like Bash, Shell, Netcat, Ruby, among other examples.

The shells contained here are extensively tested to be sure they are free of malwares, malicious payloads, etc.

Please feel free to investigate them before use. If you find anything suspicious (...more then usual), just let me know.

I'll try to keep the shells with their original names, but using .txt extensions


# Shell Information Structure

Every shell will be kept in a directory with it's proper name, inside the directory within the language it was developed, such as:

1. Name 
2. Author
3. Language
4. Year (when known)
