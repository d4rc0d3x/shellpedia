# shellpedia
Collection of Shells and Web Shells

Shellpedia is meant to be a repository/collection of Shells and Web Shells found on the Internet, and ways to use them. Here you will find Web Shells such as PHP, ASP, .NET, JavaScript, Java, JSP, etc. Also system shells like Bash, Shell, Netcat, among others.

The shells contained here are extensively tested to be sure they are free of malwares, malicious payloads, etc.

Please feel free to investigate them before use. If you find anything suspicious (...more then usual), just let me know.

I'll try to keep the shells with their original names, but using .txt extensions

DISCLAIMER

The shells here are meant to be used for study only and not to be used for real attacks or backdoors. Use it at your own risk.


Happy Hacking
